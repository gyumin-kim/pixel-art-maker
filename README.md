# Pixel Art Maker Project

This is a "Pixel Art Maker" project of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s _[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)_ as practice. With this project, I could get used to interacting with Javascript & the DOM(Document Object Model), and using event listeners to create user interfaces.
